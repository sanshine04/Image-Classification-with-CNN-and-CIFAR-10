# Image-Classification-with-CNN-and-CIFAR-10
This repository contains a simple image classification project using TensorFlow and Keras. The project includes a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into one of ten categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, or truck.
